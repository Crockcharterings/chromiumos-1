The X Server currently depends on "hal", but we disable it.

This fake_hal package satisfies the hal package dependency without pulling
in all of the dependencies that hal has. It does depend on libhal1 since
the x server will still load that library even if we use "AutoAddDevices"
option to disable hal.

The Ubuntu community is working toward removing hal as part of their fast
booting initiative. Until then, we'll use fake_hal.
