This directory contains server-side test cases for Chromium OS,
classified by test area. See
http://autotest.kernel.org/wiki/AutotestApi for documentation on the
distinction between client side tests and server side tests.

Individual tests that require build steps should write their output
into the site-tests output directory, from which the
chromeos-systemtests package gets built.

Test cases should exist no more than one level deep, using autotest
naming conventions.
