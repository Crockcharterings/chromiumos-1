pam_loader_ia32 is a small C program that loads pam_google.so
dynamically and checks for one of the Linux-PAM functions we expect it
to define.  It only works on ia32, hence the same of the executable.

Checking in the binary is less than ideal, but until we get the right
cross-compilation stuff into autotest, this will do.
