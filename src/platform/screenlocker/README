The screen locker is a mod of xscreensaver.  

We have heaviliy trimmed down xscreensaver to have no default screensavers.  
This leaves a simple lock mechanism that locks with a blank screen.  
Configuration is done using two files.  The pam file is in this package.
Other config and code is in third_party/xscreensaver.  

We are also not using xscreensaver-demo which relies upon GTK libraries to 
provide an easy way of changing the screensaver settings.  Instead we will 
be building a custom configuration interface in the future.
