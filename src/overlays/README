This directory contains board specific overlays.

When a board is configured using setup_board --board <name> any overlay that
matches overlay-<name> and overlay-<name>-* will be added to that boards
PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable.  The overlay-<name> directory must contain a
make.conf and a toolchain.conf.
