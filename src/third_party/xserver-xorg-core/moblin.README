The moblin-* patches are taken from the X Server sources.


They are from the xorg-x11-server-1.6.1.902-2.1.moblin2.src.rpm found
here:

http://repo.moblin.org/moblin/development/core/source/


We don't take all of the moblin X patches at the moment.

01moblin-cache-xkbcomp-output-for-fast-start-up.patch
  - Speeds up X startup by caching result of xkbcomp and re-using it. This
  can save up to about 0.75 seconds on an Atom machine.

02moblin-xserver-1.5.0-bg-none-root.patch
  - Enables "-nr" flag to have no root background. This is so that we can
  seemlessly transition from a splash screen to an X session.
