RELEASING
=========

When making a new release;

 - Verify your working directory is clean:

     $ git reset --hard <release_branch>
     $ git clean -xdf

 - Run:

     $ ./autogen.sh --enable-gtk-doc
     $ make all

 - Run:

     $ make distcheck

   and fix eventual issues. Commit the fixes.

 - Update NEWS (New feature details, bug #'s), README (Any API changes
   relevant to developers + version), AUTHORS if relevant.

 - Clean everything again with:

     $ git clean -xdf

 - Verify versioning in configure.ac, increasing relevant
   clutter_major_version/clutter_minor_version/clutter_micro_version
   value. For point releases, bump clutter_micro_version to the next
   even number.

 - If there was no API change (addition, deprecation), increment
   clutter_interface_age by two. If there was an API change,
   set clutter_interface_age to zero. The interface_age is used to
   keep the soname the same across releases.

 - Build everything again, and run distcheck to create the tarball.

 - Tag the release:

     $ git tag -s <version>

 - Bump clutter_micro_version to the next odd number version and commit.

 - Push the branch and then the tag, e.g.:

     $ git push origin master
     $ git push origin 1.2.4

 - Upload the tarball to clutter-project.org.

 - Announce release to the waiting world on the blog and mailing lists

 - Release any dependant add-ons following similar rules to above.
