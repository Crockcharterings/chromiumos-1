Version: commit dc615a21c3c43cd9071926df2633d5b23e2e726b
License: GPL v2 and LGPL v2
License File: files/COPYING

Description:
  The source code for e2fsprogs, EXT2 filesystem utilities.  This is used
by the encrypted home directory package (chromeos-cryptohome) to handle
EXT4 resizing and defragmentation.  This is transitionary until the EXT4
utilities are including in standard upstream e2fsprogs package.

Local Modification:
- Custom control and rules to very simply build e4fsprogs-git containing
  only static versions of e2fsck, mkfs.ext4, resize2fs.
- mke2fs will mark a superblock with LAZY_BG if lazy_itable_init=1 is used.
- resize2fs will honor LAZY_BG and lazily initialize inodes and blocks groups.
