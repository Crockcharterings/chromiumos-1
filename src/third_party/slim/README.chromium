Description:

This is the Simple Login Manager, which we are using as a lightweight
replacement for gdm on Chrome OS.

Local Modifications:

  * Tab now moves between the username and password fields (though we still 
    require SOMETHING) to be entered in the username field
  * We emit the login-prompt-ready signal to Upstart when the login prompt is
    showing.
  * We skip blanking the screen so that the transition between splash screen
    and login screen can appear seamless.
