Description:
  A heavily-modified version of ply-image, taken from the Plymouth
graphical boot library (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth)
  
Local Modification:
This is a standalone ply-image from the plymouth package (0.7.1) without
all the stuff we don't need, which adds to compilation time and executable
size.  It takes a .png file and centers it on the frame buffer.
