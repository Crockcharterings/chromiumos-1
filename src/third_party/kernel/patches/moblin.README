The moblin-* patches are taken from the moblin kernel sources (moblin.org).
They are from the kernel-2.6.30-6.2.moblin2.src.rpm:

http://repo.moblin.org/moblin/development/core/source/kernel-2.6.30-6.2.moblin2.src.rpm


We currently take all of the moblin patches. After a brief inspection there
didn't seem to be any that we wouldn't want. In particular, we want the
retry-root-mount, dont-wait-for-mouse, kms-run-async, and kms-after-sata
patches for boot speed.

Here is a summary trimmed from their spec file:

#
# Patch to add a "nonintconfig" option to the Makefile
# needed for unattended builds
#
Patch1: linux-2.6-build-nonintconfig.patch

#
# First come all the "straight backport" patches. These come first so
# that when we rebase, we can just drop them without impacting the
# other patches in the series. The backport patches are sorted
# "big to small" to minimize conflicts
#
Patch2: 0001-dm-exception-store-fix-exstore-lookup-to-be-case-in.patch
Patch3: fix-device-mapper-regression.patch


# Kernel CVE patches - these go last in the backport section
# drm/i915 suspend/resume fix
Patch4: linux-2.6.31-drm-i915-correct-suspend-resume-ordering.patch
