Using the 2.6.30 kernel on an Asus S101 we are seeing a constant stream
of kernel messages that look like:

[<timestamp>] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank counter, -22

The message looks ominous but the system is not obviously affected.

However, this is causing the kernel logger to dump all of these message to
/var/log/kern.log, which was up to 4 MB after about 15 minutes of machine
usage.

TODO: We should monitor future kernels to see if this issue is fixed and
remove this patch as soon as we can.
