The copy-fb patch copies the initial framebuffer contents when starting
X so that we can have a seamless transition splash screen and the X session
that is used for login.

The patch has been updated to apply to a newer version of the Intel
drivers. It is based on the copy-fb.patch found in the Fedora sources
located here:
