xscreensaver (5.0.8-0ubuntu5cr2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Restore still-referenced ignore_all_errors_ehandler function to
    driver/lock.c.
  * Drop -std=c89 for the moment. Somehow a // comment crept into
    <bits/string3.h>. We ought to fix this, but drop the strictness for now.
  * Add more complete build-dependencies, and use automatically-generated
    dependencies rather than hardcoding them.
